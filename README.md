Splatoon 3 replay lookup API
---

API server to look up Splatoon 3 replay codes using SplatNet 3 with nxapi.

This can be used to fetch your NPLN user ID (used to generate your initial seed) using a replay code you've created: https://leanny.github.io/splat3seedchecker/#/settings.

This is using the new API client library (https://github.com/samuelthomas2774/nxapi/issues/42) that handles all authentication and in-memory data caching. This API will change.

### Public API

This is only intended for use with https://leanny.github.io/splat3seedchecker/#/. Send me a message in the [nxapi Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/4D82rFkXRv) if you'd like to use it for anything else.

Status is available at https://nxapi-status.fancy.org.uk. Usage stats are available at https://ubuntu-2204-vm-test.fancy.org.uk/grafana/public-dashboards/80199d52798448fda34da31edaac2cc0.
